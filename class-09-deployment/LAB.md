## AWS Deployment

**This is a Solo assignment**
<!-- short description of project -->
Today we'll be shifting gears a bit and setting up the AWS environment for deploying our application. Going forward, these will be processes that we complete at the onset of any projects we create!

## Specifications
<!-- Write a spefication for the features required in this lab assignment -->

### Setup
- You should already have an account with AWS. If not, head [over there](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="_blank"} and sign up!

### Features
- Deploy your application to AWS! 
- It's important that you complete your deployment in a programmatic way today, so please follow the [deployment tutorial](./notes/deployment.md){:target="_blank"} or lecture videos closely if you're unclear on how to proceed.

### Testing
- No test requirements for today's lab.

## Submission
1. Upon successfully configuring and deploying your application, copy the link to your deployed EC2 instance.
1. Submit the link to your deployed instance, as well as a link to your repository, in the provided url submission area in this assignment.
1. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
