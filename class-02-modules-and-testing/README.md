## Daily Plan
- Notes:
    - Anything top of mind?

- Code Review (every day, but not today...)
- Data structures & Code challenges   
    - Challenge 01 Example
- Testing in Python & Test Driven Development
- Python Modules & Packages
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

- Students will understand what differentiates a module from a package
- Students will have an idea of how to import modules/packages
- Students will be introduced to testing and one method of how it can work in Python
- Students will understand the measurements of space and time complexity in algorithms using Big-O notation
- Students will be introduced to a daily whiteboarding practice, and will use this process for the duration of the course
